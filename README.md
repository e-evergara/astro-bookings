# ActivityBookings 

> Express with TypeScript version for Activity Bookings system

A fictional activity booking system used during training sessions and demos.

A **backend API** for offering bookings to activities by registered users

- Activities are scheduled for specific dates with pricing and minimum and maximum participant thresholds.
- Activity status lifecycle: draft → published -> confirmed → done or cancelled.
- A user will be identified by their email address, having a username and password.
- One user can book multiple activities, but cannot exceed the available seats.
- Users will be billed upon booking, and payments will be processed through a mock gateway.

For demo purposes:

- Security is based on simple JWT tokens.
- Data persistence is handled using JSON files
